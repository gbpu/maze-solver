# Maze solver 

Python code that solves mazes similar to [www.mazegenerator.net](www.mazegenerator.net)


## How to run
- Download a maze image from [www.mazegenerator.net](www.mazegenerator.net) or use from Maze_example folder
![20 by 20 unsolveld maze](./'20 by 20 orthogonal maze.png')

- Run `maze_solver.py` 

- The programm will ask you to enter with the path to the maze image and to enter with the size of the mesh. 
To run one of the examples, type "Maze_examples/20 by 20 orthogonal maze.png" and then "20 20".

- An image of the solution will be saved in the current folder. 
Following the example: "SOLUTION20x20.png"
![20 by 20 solveld maze](./SOLUTION20x20.png')
